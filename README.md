# Plotly_Deployment

## Overview
In this project, graphs were created using Plotly to visualize the data for different users. The updated webpage will continue to display different demographic data for each user selected. Now it will be accompanied by three different charts reflecting the different types of bacteria, their intensity, as well as a rough estimation of personal hygiene for each user. This will allow users to compare the existing bacteria with potential priorities for Improbable Beef.
